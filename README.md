# class_projects
# This is a collection of projects that I have done throughout college, for the purpose of showing my programming ability on my github profile. It contains various projects in various programming languages, primarily C++ and Python. To my knowledge, these projects are no longer given by professors at my university and I do not condone any form of academic dishonesty.
